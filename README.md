Hi👋
I’m Sara Szwejkowska. I’m from Giżycko but I have lived in Gdańsk for 2 years.
I’m interested in React since December 2021 year. It was fall in love from first sight :)
I’m currently learning to write code in JS and I’m focused on creating as many projects as possible - because as we know - practice teaches us the most.

I want to gain as much knowledge as possible, which is why I started my IT studies and regularly use the services of a mentor who watches over the quality of my code and the process of acquiring knowledge.✨

I’m looking to collaborate with company where I could develop myself under the supervision of specialists. I’m interested in intership 🙏🏻

What can I do at the moment? 💬

Git,
the basics of JavaScript,
HTML&CSS,
SCSS,
Bootstrap,
Figma,
Photoshop,
SAP ERP,
Agile/Scrum,
ITIL4
